Cython Solution:
The Cython solution just uses the Interpreter/Histogram and CLusterizer class and creates Python Modules from their C++ code. 
It is platform independent and allows Pytables Blosc compression in tables.
1. make sure you have cython installed
2. run setup.py with cython to build libraries:
   python.exe setup.py build_ext --inplace
