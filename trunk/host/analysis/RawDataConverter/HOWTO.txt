1. define environment variables:
	- remeber to use the short form representation for your paths (program files = progra~1). Otherwise Visual Studio has issues
	- HDF5 variable should be set to the installation subdirectory mentioning your version (like c:\progra~1\HDF_Group\HDF5\1.8.10)
	- BLOSCvariable should be set to the directory with the BLOSC files (like C:\progra~1\HDF_Group\blosc-1.1.5)

2. create a bin directory in the folder %BLOSC% and give access to the Visual Studio user to write into it. (right mouse click-->properties--> security...)
3. open the solution and compile, only the release configuration writes into the BLOSC folder and has the appropriate compiler flags (SSE2) set
4. you might need to set the correct path for the header/cpp files
